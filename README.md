#Parallel Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
#Description:
 Find the length of the longest common subsequence (non- consecutive characters) of two strings
# Inputs:
 Two different strings (Max: 1000000 each)
# Outputs:
  The length of the longest common subsequence
# Example Input:
 “computer”
 “houseboat”
# Example Output:
  Longest common subsequence = 3
  Note : the common subsequences are : ou– oue - out
